# Create a Running Web Page Server
This tutorial we set up a web server that can serve a web page.

## What is Nginxï¼Ÿ
Nginx is a Russian written software and is aming at replacing Apache. They both serve as a web content provider server. Apache is widely used and is heavy. Nginx is lightweight, has limited functions, but faster.

## How to use nginx?
We usuall use `nginx` to serve static contents, for example, `html, jpg, png, css` files. We need to configure two things in order for `nginx` to work, we need to provide

1. html, png, jpg files that you want to server to the visitors.

2. configurations of nginx, "how to" serve the content we provided.

### Nginx Static Content Place
By default, we put html content into `/usr/share/nginx/html` folder, `/usr/share/` folder is the place to place optional user data, where it is accessable for everyone. We put the `index.html` there.

### Nginx Configuration Place
By default, we put configurations into `/etc/nginx/` folder. Under this folder, by Unix convention, we can predcit that `nginx.conf` is the main configuration. And inside the `conf.d` folder, several user defined configurations are placed here to take effect. The main configuration is used first by nginx, then nginx will read the configurations in `conf.d` folder to check out user preferences. Then override the default main configuration.

## What is docker file?
Docker file is a file. It is a chart for docker daemon to build an image. You can think of it as a `starting script` to build an image, based on other images. It will mainly contain three parts: 1. The base image it is based on. 2. The commands (usually commands of installation) to execute furthur on the image. 3. The optional command that will execute if the user doesn't specify a command when he launches this image.

Let us see the example docker file of this static website: [Dockerfile](https://github.com/docker/labs/blob/master/beginner/static-site/)
```
FROM nginx
ENV AUTHOR=Docker

WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY Hello_docker.html /usr/share/nginx/html

CMD cd /usr/share/nginx/html && sed -e s/Docker/"$AUTHOR"/ Hello_docker.html > index.html ; nginx -g 'daemon off;'
```

The `FROM` indicates which base image we are building upon, here is `nginx` image (it is in online docker registry), then it assigns an linux env variable `AUTHOR`. It specifies the install commands are executed inside this `WORKDIR`, so the following commands are executed in the container, under the specified directory. After that, it copies `Hello_docker.html` to the container, copies to `/usr/share/nginx/html` directory. Finally, it specifies a `CMD` as a command to execute if the user launching the image doesn't speicify a command to do.

In the command, it uses a `sed` command to subsitute the text `Docker` into the value of local variable `$AUTHOR` in Hello_docker.html, output the result to index.html. Then it executes the command `nginx -g 'daemon off;'` to let the nginx to run in the foreground. (Hence the launched container will not exit after nginx starts, because normal nginx will spawn child process then return immediately after launching.)

As we have discussed before, `nginx` program will go into its default configuration location: `/etc/nginx` to look for default configuration and user configurations, then it will start using these configurations.

# Explore the web server image
The previous discussed imagea is already existing in the docker registry. It is called `seqvence/static-site`, let us pull it and execute it.
```
$ docker pull seqvence/static-site

$ docker run --name my-static-site -e AUTHOR="Francis Underwood" -p 8888:80 -it seqvence/static-site sh
# We use name flag to give our container a name, use -e to pass an environment variable, use -p to let host 8888 port mapping to container 80 port.
Use -it to get an interactive terminal. And finally, we override the default CMD by telling the container to execute sh command. So we log in and get a command line prompt.
```

Then we go into the container and it is a rabbit hole. We can check the files in the container by:
```
# ls /usr/share/nginx/html
50x.html  Hello_docker.html  index.html

# ls /etc/nginx/
conf.d	fastcgi_params	koi-utf  koi-win  mime.types  modules  nginx.conf  scgi_params	uwsgi_params  win-utf

# ls /etc/nginx/conf.d
default.conf
```

If you further using `cat` command to list the content of `nginx.conf` and `default.conf`, you will see these configurations tell the nginx to serve the webpage of `/usr/share/nginx/index.html` publicly when visitor visit the container at 80 port. Since we didn't execute the default long `CMD` as specified in Dockerfile, the container is now not running nginx.

# Launch the webserver image, get running container

As we have done exploring the file system of container, we simply type `exit` to get off. Then we lauch a new container and let it execute the `CMD` it defined in default settings and see the result:
```
$ docker run --name my-static-site-again -e AUTHOR="Benjamin Franklin" -p 8888:80 seqvence/static-site
# This time we didn't lauch in -it mode, we didn't specify the command to enter the container. So it will execute default CMD specified in Dockerfile
```

Now we can visit our little website on your local machine `http://localhost:8888/`, or if you run on a remote server in cloud, by `http:/your-server-ip:8888/`

# Clean up your containers

When you have done with playing our little website, you can use `docker ps -a` to list all the running/stopped containers, use `docker stop [container name]` to stop a container, and `docker rm [container name]` to wipe the container out from disk.
