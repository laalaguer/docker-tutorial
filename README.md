My Docker Tutorial - A review

# History
My old days with docker can date back to docker 1.2, and while it was around mid.2015. Then it evolves and has docker-compose and other features.

# Purpose
As starting of 2017-1-1, I want to re-learn my knowledge of docker containers and monitor the status of the containers.
